# advent-of-code-2023
This is my attempt at solving advent of code 2023 in a programming language I've never used before - rust.

WARNING: There are no guarentees that any of the the code in this repository is idiomatic rust code, in fact I can probably give you the opposite guarentee.

# Running the tasks
Run this via `cargo run` e.g.
```bash
cargo run --bin task1 -- ./task1.txt
```
